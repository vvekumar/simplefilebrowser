Assumptions:
- Docker mounts desired directories during deployment (having the effect of only providing mounted directories available through the API for browsing)

Open Issues :
[1] *DONE* Accept path/query params for root / relpath {Curl/Browser args difference}
[1-1] *DONE* Parsing relpath as query parameter has issue
[2] Providing root path to explore, shows recursive traversal results
[3] curl '-o' does not save output
[4] Parsing relpath as query parameter has issue from curl request {Curl/Browser args difference}


TODO:
[1] Add unit tests - API (auth, various requests)
[2] *DONE* Add Dockerfile
[3] *DONE* Add Dockerfile-Compose/Makefile (https://medium.com/@daniel.carlier/how-to-build-a-simple-flask-restful-api-with-docker-compose-2d849d738137)
[4] *DONE* Add Basic Auth
[5] Check user perms for showing contents of FS node requested
[6] *DONE* Add example driver bash script
[7] *DONE* API documentation (note: optional, add example for a sample file as request)
